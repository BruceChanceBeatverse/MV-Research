# **1. What is a Prompt**

- In AI video generation, a prompt is a descriptive text or instruction used to guide the AI model in creating specific video content. Simply put, you need to describe the video scene you want to generate in the prompt.
- Prompts generally include descriptive text, instruction parameters, emotional atmosphere, and reference style. These aspects will be explained in detail.

# **2. Prompt Language**

It is recommended to use **English** for input as PixVerse understands English best and yields the best results.

If you are not familiar with English, you can use your native language. PixVerse's model can handle input in any language.

# **3. Prompt Content**

## **3.1 Descriptive Text**

Provide detailed text describing the content you wish to generate. Use natural language and be as simple and detailed as possible to avoid ambiguity, classical language, poetry, or idiomatic expressions.

If unsure how to describe, use this formula: **subject + subject description + action + environment**, i.e., "What + where + doing what."

**Example:**

- A white cruise ship sails slowly across the sea.

## **3.2 Instruction Parameters**

Typically include video length, resolution, frame rate, etc.

PixVerse generates videos with a default length of 4 seconds, resolution of 1408x768 (longer videos will be supported in future updates).

Upscaling can increase the resolution to 4K, significantly enhancing video quality but also increasing generation time.
