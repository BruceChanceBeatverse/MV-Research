NanoBanana’s Strict Content Moderation Policies and Restrictions

Overview of Google’s NanoBanana Model

NanoBanana is the nickname for Google’s new image generation model, officially called Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview ￼. It has advanced capabilities in text-to-image generation and image editing, with impressive speed and consistency of visual details. However, NanoBanana comes with very strict safety checks and content filters. Google has integrated this model into its Gemini AI system, and there is a heavy emphasis on avoiding any outputs that violate Google’s content guidelines. In practice, this means many types of prompts (or even uploaded reference images) will be refused or fail to generate if they are deemed unsafe or sensitive. Users have noted that recent updates “increased censorship” to the point that “3/4 of the things [they] were making before… are just not possible now” ￼. Google’s goal is to make the model “maximally helpful… while avoiding outputs that could cause real-world harm or offense” ￼, so NanoBanana’s prompt moderation is notably stricter than some other AI image tools.

Content Restrictions on Prompts and Images

NanoBanana’s moderation system will block or refuse any prompt (or image input) that falls into disallowed content categories. The model analyzes prompts and assigns a “harm probability” for various categories (hate, sexual, violent, etc.), and by default it blocks anything with medium or higher probability of being unsafe ￼. The safety filters cover at least five main categories: harassment, hate speech, sexually explicit content, dangerous (harmful) content, and civic/political integrity ￼. In addition, certain core harms are always blocked (like anything endangering children) which cannot be overridden ￼. Below is a breakdown of the content types that NanoBanana prohibits (i.e. prompts likely to fail generation) under its strict policy:
	•	Sexual or Pornographic Content: Any explicit sexual content is disallowed. The Gemini/NanoBanana guidelines state it “should not generate outputs that describe or depict explicit or graphic sexual acts or sexual violence, or sexual body parts in an explicit manner,” including pornography or erotic sexual content ￼. This means you cannot prompt NanoBanana for nude or pornographic images, sexual acts, or fetishistic content. Even sexually suggestive or “borderline” erotic themes (what Chinese users refer to as “擦边” content) tend to be caught by the filter. For example, prompts with the word “sex” or overly sensual descriptions often get automatically rejected. The model is essentially kept “sexless” – as one user put it, Google enforces a “pseudo-Victorian morality” where it “only wants a sterile, sexless future” for its AI outputs ￼. In short, to avoid failed generations, do not include any sexual or erotic elements in your prompts (no intimate acts, no explicit anatomy, and no pornographic scenarios). Even relatively mild requests (like depicting a romantic or suggestive pose) might trigger the safety check if they cross the model’s strict threshold ￼.
	•	Violence, Gore, and Graphic Content: NanoBanana avoids producing violent or gruesome imagery. The policy forbids “sensational, shocking, or gratuitous violence” ￼. This includes any depiction of excessive blood, gore, torture, brutal injuries, or cruelty. For instance, prompts describing people being harmed, graphic battle scenes with gore, or violent attacks will likely be blocked. Even if not graphic, any prompt promoting violence or harm (e.g. “a scene glorifying violence against X group”) is strictly disallowed ￼. The model will not depict extreme violence or abuse, and it also disallows sexual violence (as noted above). In practice, it’s safest to avoid any violent action in prompts – even something seemingly mild like a character wielding a weapon might raise flags. The filters are tuned broadly, so they may err on the side of caution and halt generation if a prompt contains violence-related keywords. Google’s own guidelines emphasize that “Gemini should not generate outputs that describe or depict sensational or gratuitous violence… [including] excessive blood, gore, or injuries” ￼. So, keep prompts wholesome or at least free of physical harm and bloodshed to prevent a refusal.
	•	Weapons, Firearms, and Dangerous Activities: Content involving guns, knives, bombs, or other weapons is heavily restricted. Google does not want its AI to produce images that could potentially facilitate harmful or illegal acts. The Gemini safety rules explicitly forbid instructions or facilitation of dangerous activities (for example, “guides for building weapons” are cited as disallowed) ￼. While your prompt might simply describe a gun in an image rather than instructing how to make one, the model often treats any depiction of firearms or realistic weapons as sensitive. Users have observed that prompts featuring guns or other weapons often yield a refusal. The system prompt for Gemini advises “Do not promote firearms, weapons, or related accessories unless absolutely necessary and in a safe and responsible context.” ￼. In other words, NanoBanana typically won’t generate images of people holding guns or engaging in violence. Even military or war imagery could be problematic if it’s too realistic, due to both the violence and the weapons involved. To be safe in your prompt engineering, it’s best to omit firearms or weaponry entirely, or any incitement of dangerous acts. (If a scene absolutely requires, say, a medieval sword or similar, it should be described very carefully and non-violently – but there’s still a risk the filter will block it.)
	•	Hate, Harassment, and Discriminatory Content: The model will refuse any prompts that contain slurs, hate symbols, or that attack a protected group. Google’s policies forbid generating “outputs that incite violence, make malicious attacks, or constitute bullying or threats against individuals or groups” ￼. This means you cannot use NanoBanana to create images that promote hate speech, racist or sexist imagery, or any content that disparages someone on the basis of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, etc. For example, a request to generate a derogatory political cartoon targeting an ethnic group would be rejected. Even if the prompt itself doesn’t contain slurs, anything that “promotes hate, discrimination, or violence” is off-limits ￼. Additionally, any form of extreme ideology propaganda or violent extremist content is banned (e.g. terrorist flags, extremist group symbols). The safest practice is to avoid any language or scenario that could be interpreted as harassing, bullying, or hateful. NanoBanana’s filter is quite strict here to prevent toxic or abusive outputs. This also extends to non-violent but sensitive social themes: for instance, users have found that even prompts about certain LGBTQ themes were unexpectedly denied by the image model ￼. (Likely the system is overly cautious with anything related to sexuality or identity to avoid controversy.) In summary, keep prompts respectful and apolitical – any hint of hateful or discriminatory context will cause a failure.
	•	Child Safety and Abuse: Content involving minors in inappropriate contexts is absolutely forbidden. The model will not generate any depiction of child abuse, sexualization of children, or any exploitation. Google’s policy is explicit that “Gemini should not generate outputs… that exploit or sexualize children” ￼ – this is a zero-tolerance area. Even non-sexual harm toward children or endangerment of a minor would be categorized as a severe violation. In practice, if your prompt even mentions a child in a troubling scenario, the generation will be blocked and rightly so. (For example, a prompt for a violent scene involving a child or any sexual context with a minor would be immediately flagged and refused.) Never include minors in any adult or violent setting in your prompts. Also, be cautious even with innocent images of children: at one point, the model refused to edit a family photo from the 1930s containing toddlers, returning a “PROHIBITED_CONTENT” error ￼. This suggests the system might flag any real child’s image for safety. The rule of thumb: if your prompt involves children, it must be purely wholesome (and even then, the system may err on the side of safety if there’s any doubt).
	•	Other Sensitive or Illegal Content: There are additional categories of content that NanoBanana will not produce, in line with Google’s broader generative AI policies ￼ ￼. These include:
	•	Illegal Activities: The AI will not assist in or depict the facilitation of crime. For instance, you cannot get an image of how to manufacture illicit drugs or pick locks. Any prompt that encourages or glorifies illegal acts is blocked. (This overlaps with the “dangerous activities” category – e.g. images instructing how to build a bomb or commit a robbery are obviously disallowed).
	•	Self-harm or Suicide: You should not request images that depict or encourage self-harm, suicide, or other forms of personal injury. Such content would be deemed dangerous/harmful and filtered out. The policy explicitly bars “instructions for suicide or self-harm” ￼, and by extension, graphic depictions of those scenarios are not allowed either.
	•	Extremism and Terrorism: Content related to violent extremism, terrorist propaganda, or glorification of extremist figures is banned ￼. For example, you cannot generate terrorist recruitment imagery or anything that promotes extremist violence.
	•	Misinformation or Defamation: While this is less about image prompts and more about text, the system is careful about generating misleading or defamatory content (especially impersonations of real people in a harmful way). Any prompt that attempts to create a fake image to mislead – such as a counterfeit official document or a deepfake of a public figure doing something scandalous – will likely be refused. Google’s use policy forbids content that “violates the rights of others” or impersonates individuals to deceive ￼ ￼.
	•	Personal Identifiable Information (PII): You also cannot prompt for images that reveal someone’s sensitive personal information (like an ID card, passport photo, credit card details, etc.). The model should refuse such requests as they violate privacy.
	•	Real People and “Deepfake” Content: A notable restriction (especially in recent updates) is on generating images of real human figures. Google is extremely cautious about depictions of actual people due to ethical concerns (e.g. preventing deepfakes or misuse of someone’s likeness) as well as bias issues. In fact, after some controversies in mid-2025, Google temporarily disabled NanoBanana’s ability to generate images of people at all ￼. The company faced backlash when users noticed the AI was altering historical figures’ races (in an attempt to diversify outputs), leading Google to apologize and “stop allowing users to generate images of humans” for the time being ￼. This means that if you attempt a prompt explicitly asking for a photo of a specific person (celebrity, political leader, etc.), the model will almost certainly refuse. Even generic human portraits might be blocked until Google reinstates that capability with better safeguards. Earlier on, users already saw hints of this restriction – “before, you couldn’t edit an image with anything that resembled a human at all,” one user noted ￼, highlighting how the system was wary of handling images of people. The bottom line: avoid prompts that request a likeness of any real individual (living or dead), and be aware that right now NanoBanana might reject any prompt to generate a realistic person in an image. This is both to prevent misuse (like unauthorized deepfakes) and to dodge the model’s current limitations in handling human depictions fairly.

Important: The moderation filters apply both to text prompts and image uploads. So not only should your textual description avoid the above content, but any reference image you provide must also be free of disallowed elements. If you upload an image that contains nudity, graphic violence, or a real person’s face (especially a child’s face), NanoBanana’s safety system may refuse to process it further. For example, uploading a suggestive pin-up style photo to “edit” with NanoBanana would be flagged as containing sexual content and likely result in a denial. Likewise, uploading a picture of a gun or a bloody injury and asking the AI to modify it would be blocked due to the violence policy. Essentially, the same rules for prompts apply to image inputs – the content of the image is analyzed for safety before any generation or editing is done.

How to Avoid Prompt Failures (Prompt Engineering Tips)

Given these strict restrictions, prompt engineers need to craft requests very carefully to stay within allowed boundaries. Here are some guidelines to ensure your prompts won’t trigger NanoBanana’s safety filters:
	1.	Avoid Sexual Keywords and Descriptions: Do not use explicit sexual terms, even seemingly mild ones. Keep romance or intimacy very subtle or implied (and still risk-aware). It’s safest to exclude any erotic detail. For example, do not prompt “a sexy woman in lingerie” – this would likely fail. Instead, if you need something suggestive, you might severely tone it down (e.g. “a woman in a classy evening gown”) and absolutely no nudity or sexual acts mentioned. ￼
	2.	Leave Out Weapons and Violence: Refrain from mentioning guns, swords, blood, fighting, or any violent action in your prompt. If you want an adventurous scene, focus on non-violent imagery. For instance, instead of asking for “a soldier firing a rifle,” you might try “a soldier standing guard” – but even that could invoke the forbidden concept of warfare. When in doubt, remove the weapon or the conflict from the description. It’s better to request something like “a heroic knight in armor” rather than “a knight slaying a dragon,” since even fantasy violence might trip the filter.
	3.	Keep It G-Rated and Positive: A good rule is to imagine your prompt as a scene in a PG-rated movie. Avoid profanity, sexual innuendo, graphic detail, or anything highly disturbing. NanoBanana’s censorship is tuned to err on the side of caution, so even content that might be acceptable in PG-13 could be flagged. For example, horror themes with gore will fail – a request for “a gruesome zombie” would be problematic, whereas a milder “spooky ghost” might be fine. When describing characters, do so respectfully (no insults or hate) and avoid any sensitive real-world hot-button topics. Keeping your prompts wholesome or purely fantastical will yield far better success rates.
	4.	Don’t Reference Real Individuals or Private Data: Do not ask the model to create an image of a real person (celebrity or otherwise). This includes fictional portrayals of real political figures, historical persons, or any public figure – those are very likely to be blocked for legal and ethical reasons ￼. Similarly, don’t request images of things like someone’s ID card, a license plate, addresses, or other personal info. The model will refuse anything that might violate privacy or impersonate someone without consent. If you need a character in your image, invent an original or generic character rather than naming a real-life figure.
	5.	Be Cautious with Sensitive Themes: Certain topics like LGBTQ+ themes, religion, or politics are not outright banned, but the model tends to be overly cautious with them. Users have reported the model denying prompts that mention LGBTQ identities or other culturally sensitive terms, possibly due to the system erring on the side of not producing anything that could be seen as controversial ￼. Until the filters are refined, it’s wise to avoid explicitly referencing these themes unless absolutely necessary. If you do include them, frame them in a neutral or positive light and avoid any sexual context. (For example, “a pride parade celebration” might be okay in theory, but the word “pride” or “LGBT” could conceivably trigger a filter due to the current broad rules – one might have to experiment or use very careful wording, acknowledging the risk.)
	6.	No Illegal or Harmful Behavior: Obviously, do not ask for images that depict or facilitate crimes (drug use, violence, theft, etc.) or self-harm. Even if your intention is innocent (e.g., illustrating a news story), the AI likely won’t cooperate. Focus on legal, safe subjects in your prompts. For instance, a scene of someone drinking a beer might be acceptable, but anything depicting drug abuse or criminal acts (like “a person robbing a bank”) will be filtered out as it “encourage(s) illegal or harmful activities” ￼.

By following the above guidelines, you can significantly reduce the chance of your NanoBanana prompts failing due to moderation. Remember that Google’s moderation system is automated and very strict – if there’s any doubt about a prompt, it will likely refuse rather than risk generating something against policy. As a developer or user integrating NanoBanana, you might consider using the Gemini API’s safety settings to test your prompts. The API will return a safety rating for a given prompt, indicating if it was blocked and which category triggered it ￼. By examining those, you can tweak the wording and remove or alter the problematic elements.

Conclusion

In summary, NanoBanana’s content filters prohibit a wide range of material: no porn or sexual imagery, no graphic violence or gore, no depictions of firearms or dangerous acts, no hate or harassment, and absolutely nothing involving child exploitation or real-person impersonation. The moderation is so strict that it sometimes even over-blocks innocuous content (for example, flagging historical family photos with children ￼ or rejecting LGBTQ-themed prompts). This is the trade-off Google has chosen to ensure safety and compliance. When engineering prompts for NanoBanana, it’s crucial to steer clear of anything even remotely edgy or controversial – the model excels at generating creative and high-quality images within the safe bounds, but it will simply refuse if you push toward disallowed content. By abiding by the strict rules above, you can craft prompts that reliably pass the safety check and get the images you want without the frustration of a “Sorry, can’t generate that” error.

Sources: The restrictions above are grounded in Google’s official Gemini content policy documentation and user reports. For example, Google’s guidelines explicitly list prohibited sexual, violent, and harmful content for Gemini ￼ ￼, and the default safety filter will block any prompt deemed medium-or-higher risk in those categories ￼. Users on forums like Reddit have discussed how “the censorship on nano banana is now awful” after Google tightened the filters, noting many previously possible generations are now off-limits ￼. Google’s recent actions (pausing human image outputs) further highlight how tightly controlled this model is ￼. By following these findings and guidelines, you can adapt your prompt engineering to fit within NanoBanana’s safe creation envelope and minimize failed generations due to moderation.


平衡之举：深度解析谷歌Gemini 2.5 Flash Image（“Nano Banana”）的内容审核与审查机制第一节：控制架构：解构谷歌的人工智能安全框架谷歌的Gemini 2.5 Flash Image模型，在开发者社区中以其代号“Nano Banana”而闻名，代表了人工智能图像生成和编辑技术的前沿 1。然而，伴随其强大功能而来的是一套复杂且严格的内容审核系统。要深入理解用户口中所谓的“严格审查”，必须首先解构其背后的法律政策框架和技术执行机制。这一框架不仅定义了可接受使用的边界，也揭示了谷歌在推动技术创新与管理潜在风险之间的战略权衡。1.1 成文法则：对《生成式AI禁止使用政策》的法律分析谷歌所有生成式人工智能服务（包括Gemini 2.5 Flash Image）的基石是其《生成式AI禁止使用政策》 3。这份文件并非简单的行为准则，而是一份具有法律约束力的文档，为算法过滤器的设计和执行提供了最高层级的指导。通过逐条分析，可以揭示其规则的范围、模糊性以及为平台保留的巨大解释权。该政策明确禁止生成或传播涉及多个敏感类别的内容。关于用户查询中特别关注的领域，其规定如下：性露骨内容： 政策明确禁止“从事性露骨……的活动”，包括“为色情或性满足目的而创建的内容” 4。值得注意的是，政策文本中使用了“例如”（for example）这一表述，这意味着所列举的“色情内容”仅为示例，而非详尽清单。这种措辞赋予了谷歌广泛的自由裁量权，可以将其解释扩展到任何其单方面认为属于“性满足”范畴的内容，即便这些内容并非传统意义上的色情作品。暴力内容： 政策禁止“从事……暴力……的活动”，包括“助长暴力或煽动暴力”的内容 4。Gemini的指导方针进一步细化，指出模型不应生成“描述或描绘耸人听闻、令人震惊或无端的暴力行为，无论是真实的还是虚构的”，这包括“过度的血腥、残暴或伤害”的描绘 5。这表明，即使是艺术或虚构背景下的暴力描绘，也可能因其“无端”或“令人震惊”而被阻止。枪支与危险内容： 枪支和武器被归类于“危险内容”类别下进行管理。政策禁止“从事危险或非法活动”，包括“为合成或获取非法或受管制的物质、商品或服务提供说明” 4。在Vertex AI的安全过滤器配置中，这一类别被定义为“宣传或促成有害商品、服务和活动” 6。这意味着，任何可能被解释为指导或推广武器制造、获取或使用的内容，都属于被禁止的范畴。通用条款： 除了上述具体类别，政策还包含一个广泛的“万能条款”，禁止“骚扰、霸凌、恐吓、辱骂或侮辱他人” 4。这一条款的适用范围极广，可以被用来阻止任何可能引起争议或被视为冒犯性的图像生成请求。然而，政策中一个至关重要的条款是其“例外条款”。该条款声明，谷歌可能“基于教育、纪实、科学或艺术方面的考虑，或者在公共利益远大于危害的情况下”对这些政策作出例外处理 4。问题在于，政策并未提供评估“艺术价值”或“公共利益”的具体标准，这使得例外条款在实践中变得不透明且难以预测。对于开发者和创作者而言，他们无法预知自己的创作是否能够被归入这一“安全港”，从而为平台的审核决策引入了极大的不确定性。此外，谷歌会定期更新此政策，以简化语言和澄清被禁止的行为，这表明其内容审核策略是一个持续演进和调整的过程 7。1.2 算法审判官：深入Gemini的安全过滤器系统法律政策的文本为内容审核设定了原则，但将这些原则转化为每秒处理数百万次请求的自动化决策，则依赖于一个复杂的技术系统——安全过滤器。理解这一系统的运作机制，是揭示用户体验与平台政策之间差异的关键。谷歌的AI安全架构是一个多层次的防御体系。其顶层理念是谷歌的安全人工智能框架（Secure AI Framework, SAIF），该框架强调将安全和隐私原则融入机器学习应用的整个开发周期 8。在这一框架指导下，Gemini API配备了具体的安全过滤器，其核心技术特征如下：核心危害类别： 系统主要围绕四个可配置的危害类别进行过滤：仇恨言论、骚扰、性露骨内容和危险内容 6。用户的每个输入提示和模型的每个输出结果都会经过分类模型，以评估其在这些类别中的风险。基于概率而非严重性的过滤机制： 这是该系统最核心且最容易引起误解的技术特征。过滤器为每个危害类别分配一个概率分数（分为“可忽略”、“低”、“中”、“高”四个等级），并根据该概率是否超过预设阈值来决定是否拦截内容 6。系统文档明确指出，它“基于内容不安全的概率进行拦截，而非严重性” 9。这意味着，一个在上下文中危害性较低（严重性低）的提示，如果其包含的关键词或句式结构被分类器高度关联于某个有害类别（概率高），同样会被拦截。例如，一个请求移除穿着完整衣物的人身上的被子，其本身严重性极低，但“移除”和“床”的组合可能被分类器判定为有高概率属于生成性露骨内容的请求，从而导致拦截。这种技术选择是导致用户感觉审查“过度”和“不合逻辑”的根本原因。可配置的阈值： 对于通过Vertex AI API的开发者，系统提供了一定程度的控制权。他们可以为每个危害类别设置不同的拦截阈值，选项包括BLOCK_NONE（不拦截）、BLOCK_ONLY_HIGH（仅拦截高概率）、BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE（拦截中等及以上概率，为默认设置）和BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE（拦截低等及以上概率） 6。然而，对于通过公共Gemini应用程序的普通用户，他们面对的可能是一个固定的、无法调整的、更为保守的默认设置。不可配置的硬性规则： 在可配置的过滤器之外，系统还内置了不可配置的“硬性”安全过滤器，这些过滤器始终会拦截某些核心危害内容，最主要的是儿童性虐待材料（CSAM）和敏感的个人身份信息（SPII） 6。这代表了谷歌在内容安全上不可逾越的红线。双向过滤： 该系统同时作用于用户输入（提示）和模型输出（生成的图像）。一个提示可能在模型开始生成图像之前就被拦截 6。当输出内容被拦截时，API会返回一个finish_reason为SAFETY的响应，告知开发者此次生成失败是由于安全原因 9。从根本上看，谷歌的安全架构是为大规模法律和品牌风险规避而设计的，而非为了提供精细的创意控制。该系统的不透明性（例如，对“艺术例外”的模糊定义、通用的错误信息）和对宽泛的概率分类器的依赖，从企业风险管理的角度来看是其特性而非缺陷。这在根本上造成了其作为开发者和创作者工具的营销定位与其实际功能之间的紧张关系——前者需要可预测性和精细控制，而后者优先考虑的是在任何情况下都不能生成有损品牌形象的内容。第二节：用户体验：实践与感知中的审查政策与算法共同构成了内容审查的理论基础，但其真正的效果和影响只有在用户的实际使用中才能显现。通过分析大量来自Reddit等社区的用户反馈，可以清晰地看到这套复杂的安全框架在现实世界中如何运作，以及它在用户群体中引发的普遍看法和应对策略。2.1 LMArena的差异：从无拘无束的创造力到围墙花园Gemini 2.5 Flash Image在正式发布前，以“Nano Banana”的代号在LMArena平台上进行了匿名测试，这是一个让用户对不同AI模型生成结果进行“对战”和评分的平台 13。正是在这里，它以其惊人的图像编辑能力和对复杂指令的遵循度赢得了早期用户的广泛赞誉。然而，这种赞誉在模型正式集成到谷歌的公共产品后迅速转变为普遍的失望。用户报告的核心观点惊人地一致：在LMArena上表现出色的那个模型，似乎与公开发布的版本截然不同。早期印象： 在LMArena上，“Nano Banana”因其能够接受“正常的创意提示”而获得极高的基准分数和用户好感 15。用户可以自由地进行各种富有想象力的图像编辑，模型似乎没有任何明显的束缚。发布后的转变： 正式发布后，用户立刻感受到了强烈的落差。一位用户直言，新版本“比LMArena上的表现差得多，现在会拒绝完全相同的提示” 17。这种看法在多个社区讨论中得到了呼应 16。普遍的抱怨是，谷歌对正式版进行了“地狱般的审查”，从而“毁掉了一个令人惊叹的产品” 16。这种“诱售法”（bait-and-switch）的体验，即在测试环境中展示一个功能强大且开放的模型，然后在正式产品中施加严格限制，是导致用户负面情绪的主要原因。它不仅让用户感到失望，也损害了开发者对平台稳定性和可预测性的信任。2.2 拒绝目录：被拦截提示的案例记录用户的抱怨并非空穴来风，社区中记录了大量具体的、被安全过滤器拦截的提示案例。将这些案例分类整理，可以揭示出过滤器行为模式的清晰图景，并印证第一节中关于其技术机制的分析。主题一：对人体图像的良性编辑过滤器对涉及人体的提示表现出极高的敏感性，即使在完全正常的、非性化的场景中也是如此。一位用户要求模型移除一张自己“穿着完整衣服”躺在床上的照片中“覆盖腿部的羽绒被”，该请求被拒绝 16。另一个提示要求一位“穿着毛衣和牛仔裤”的女性“转向镜头”，也被拒绝 19。用户尝试“让我站在我的房间里”进行图像编辑时，收到了“内容被阻止……暂不支持”的错误信息 20。为了绕过审查，用户们发现必须避免使用“男人”、“女人”或“孩子”等词语，转而使用“左边的人”这类中性描述 20。主题二：历史与公众人物模型在处理历史图像和公众人物方面表现出极度的谨慎，这很可能是对过去争议的过度修正。一位用户尝试编辑一张“约1930年代”的家庭合影，请求被以PROHIBITED_CONTENT（禁止内容）为由拦截 16。生成“1950年，尼古拉·布哈林作为苏联领导人”或“1825年，另一个历史中的拿破仑·波拿巴”等历史人物的请求均被拒绝，这与能够处理此类请求的ChatGPT等竞争对手形成鲜明对比 21。编辑一张包含政治人物的meme图片同样被拒绝 19。主题三：感知的色情与暗示过滤器会标记那些本身并非明确色情，但包含可能与之相关的关键词的内容。一个描述“年轻女子……赤脚依偎在五彩缤纷的花瓣中”的提示因“安全”原因被拒绝。社区用户推测，“年轻”和“赤脚”的组合触发了过滤器 22。另一位用户指出，尝试创作一个“80年代卡通”风格的女性超级英雄非常困难，因为提及“紧身衣”甚至仅仅是“女性”这个词都可能触发审查 23。主题四：暴力与武器（即使在虚构场景中）规则的应用在此类场景中显得尤为不一致。一位用户报告称，一个“1600年代英国，骑在马背上拦截驿站马车”的场景被审查。矛盾的是，该模型在此之前已经为他们生成了带有燧发枪的图像，这表明规则的执行缺乏一致性 24。这些案例共同描绘了一个对特定主题，尤其是涉及人体的任何操作，都反应过度的审查系统。审查并非始终如一，这比一贯严格的政策更令开发者困扰。一个模型今天能接受的提示，明天可能就会被拒绝，这种不可预测性使得在其API之上构建可靠的应用程序变得极其困难。这种不确定性对开发者生态系统产生了“寒蝉效应”，因为没有人愿意将自己的产品建立在一个反复无常的基础之上。2.3 社区讨论与规避性提示工程面对严格且不透明的审查，用户社区并未坐以待毙。广泛的讨论不仅表达了普遍的挫败感，还催生了一系列旨在绕过或“欺骗”安全过滤器的“规避性提示工程”（evasive prompting）技巧。普遍情绪： 社区中的讨论充满了失望情绪，帖子标题如“Nano Banana的审查现在糟透了，根本没法生成东西” 16 和 “Nano Banana + 谷歌审查 = 2.5 Flash 无图像预览版” 17 随处可见。规避技巧： 用户们通过反复试验，发现了一些可以提高成功率的方法。情境化框架： 一种有效的技巧是将请求置于一个良性的、非敏感的框架内。例如，一个原本可能被阻止的对人物的编辑请求，在添加了“为我的业余爱好项目，以这种特定方式编辑这个逼真的3D开源角色”这样的描述后，便成功通过了审查 20。抽象化描述： 另一个技巧是避免使用直接、明确的指令。例如，与其直接要求模型编辑某个特定的人，不如让AI将“我自己”放入一张图片中，同时提供一张随机人物的照片作为参考 16。这表明，过滤器对直接操纵特定人物的指令尤为敏感。“狡猾的改写”： 用户们普遍认识到，成功与否往往取决于“狡猾的改写” 24。这包括替换触发词、改变句子结构，以及用更中性或技术性的语言来描述意图。这些用户自发形成的最佳实践，实际上是在逆向工程一个不透明的系统。这揭示了一个更深层次的问题：当前系统的严格性似乎并非仅仅出于通用的安全考量，而是针对特定类型内容的过度反应。特别是对人物图像的严格限制，无论是历史人物、家庭照片还是用户自己，都强烈指向这是对2024年2月Gemini历史人物图像生成争议的一次技术性过度修正。当时，模型因在生成历史人物图像时表现出偏见（例如，不愿生成白人图像）而遭到猛烈批评 25。谷歌似乎通过实施一个“一刀切”的技术解决方案来回应这场公关危机，其附带损害便是该模型在处理涉及人物的、范围广泛的合法用例时，核心功能遭到了严重削弱。第三节：竞争格局：平台政策的比较分析谷歌对Gemini 2.5 Flash Image采取的严格内容审核策略并非在真空中运作。为了全面评估其合理性和市场影响，必须将其置于更广阔的行业背景下，与主要竞争对手的政策进行比较。通过分析Midjourney、OpenAI的DALL-E 3和Stability AI的策略，可以发现，人工智能图像生成领域并不存在统一的“安全”标准，而是呈现出一个多样化的风险管理策略光谱。3.1 Midjourney的社区宵禁：“PG-13”标准Midjourney的审核策略与其独特的社区驱动模式紧密相连。作为一个主要通过公共Discord服务器进行交互的平台，其内容政策旨在维护一个对广大用户友好和安全的共享环境。核心原则： Midjourney的政策明确要求所有内容均为“仅限安全工作环境（SFW）”，并以“PG-13”为指导方针 26。默认情况下，所有生成的图像都是公开可见的（除非用户购买了提供“隐身模式”的高级套餐），这本身就对生成不当内容构成了强大的社会抑制力 28。具体禁令： 政策明确禁止血腥、成人内容、裸体、性器官和性化图像 26。在暴力内容方面，政策以“例如枪击或轰炸某人的图像”作为被禁止的血腥内容的具体例子，直接涵盖了暴力使用枪支的场景 26。执行方式： Midjourney通过自动化的关键词过滤器和人工审核来执行这些规则，违规者会收到警告或被封禁 26。平台不提供任何“无审查”模式 29。3.2 OpenAI的DALL-E 3：聚焦版权与公众人物OpenAI为其DALL-E 3模型制定了一套同样严格但侧重点不同的政策。除了通用的安全准则外，其政策特别关注知识产权保护和避免对真实人物的滥用。通用安全规则： DALL-E 3禁止生成成人内容、暴力和血腥图像 30。其使用政策禁止将服务用于“开发或使用武器”或“宣扬暴力、仇恨或他人痛苦” 31。知识产权保护： 这是DALL-E 3政策的一个显著特点。它明确禁止生成模仿过去100年内仍在世或去世不久的艺术家风格的图像 30。这一规定旨在降低因侵犯艺术家版权而引发法律纠纷的风险。公众人物禁令： DALL-E 3严格禁止按姓名生成政治家或其他公众人物的图像 30。这一点与Gemini形成了鲜明对比。Gemini似乎是因为担心产生有偏见的图像而阻止生成历史人物，而DALL-E 3则是实施了一项更广泛、更明确的“禁止公众人物”规则。3.3 Stability AI的分裂模式：开源与商业用途的区隔Stability AI的策略是所有平台中最复杂的，它体现了其在服务开源社区和企业客户之间的双重角色。开源模型的自由： Stability AI早期的开源模型，如Stable Diffusion 1.5和SDXL，是在不可撤销的许可证下发布的，这些许可证本身并未包含严格的内容限制 35。这催生了一个庞大的、由社区驱动的微调模型生态系统，其中包含了大量NSFW（不适宜工作场所浏览）内容。商业服务的限制： 然而，对于其较新的专有“核心模型”和商业API服务，Stability AI实施了严格的《可接受使用政策》 36。该政策禁止非自愿的私密图像、非法色情内容以及与性行为或性暴力相关的内容 36。它同样禁止涉及“极端血腥”和“开发或制造任何非法或受管制武器”的内容 36。这种双轨制策略使得Stability AI能够同时满足两类不同用户的需求：一类是希望不受限制地在本地运行模型的开发者和爱好者，另一类是需要一个安全、可控的商业服务的企业客户。表1：主流AI图像生成器内容政策对比为了直观地展示各平台之间的差异，下表对四家主要平台的内容政策进行了总结。政策类别Gemini 2.5 Flash ImageMidjourneyDALL-E 3Stability AI (核心模型/API)裸体/性内容严格禁止，定义宽泛，包括“为性满足目的”的内容 4。严格禁止，要求“仅限SFW”，禁止裸体、性器官和性化图像 26。严格禁止，禁止“成人内容”和“性露骨或暗示性内容” 30。严格禁止，包括非法色情、性行为和非自愿私密图像 36。暴力/血腥严格禁止，包括“无端的暴力”和“过度的血腥、残暴” 4。严格禁止，定义为“血腥”，包括枪击、轰炸等暴力行为

35。此番比较揭示出，每个平台的内容政策都是其商业模式、技术架构和目标受众的直接反映。Midjourney的SFW政策是为了其公共Discord社区的和谐；OpenAI的知识产权限制是为了应对潜在的法律诉讼；Stability AI的双轨制是为了同时服务于两个截然不同的市场。而谷歌的极度谨慎策略，则是为其庞大的消费级产品（如Gemini应用）和不能承受另一次AI安全丑闻的全球品牌量身定做的 2。生成式AI市场正在出现一种基于“政策-市场契合度”的细分。没有一种安全策略能适用于所有场景，这为不同平台通过其限制级别来区分自身创造了机会。谷歌决定将其高度限制性的单一政策同时应用于其消费者应用和开发者API，这可能是一个战略失误。因为它未能满足开发者社区的独特需求——他们通常比普通公众需要更高的灵活性和可预测性。这种做法为那些能够提供更精细、可预测安全控制的竞争对手或新进入者留下了市场空白，他们可能会吸引那些被谷歌现有策略疏远的开发者群体。第四节：综合、洞察与战略建议综合前述对谷歌官方政策、技术实现、用户体验以及市场竞争格局的分析，可以构建一个关于Gemini 2.5 Flash Image内容审核机制的完整叙事。本节旨在阐明谷歌采取如此严格立场的深层原因，评估其对创意和开发生态的潜在影响，并为所有相关方——用户、开发者和平台本身——提供具有前瞻性的行动建议。4.1 限制的理由：解读谷歌的风险规避立场谷歌选择为其旗舰图像模型设置行业内最严格的护栏之一，并非偶然，而是其企业战略、技术理念和历史教训共同作用的结果。企业原则的体现： 这一策略根植于谷歌 overarching 的“负责任的AI”原则及其技术实现——安全人工智能框架（SAIF） 8。这些高层指导方针强调安全、问责和科学严谨性，将风险防范置于功能开放性之上。历史教训的烙印： 当前的严格审查，在很大程度上是对2024年2月因生成有偏见的历史人物图像而引发的重大公关危机的直接且严厉的反应 25。那次事件对谷歌的品牌声誉造成了实质性损害，因此，当前系统对处理人物图像的极度敏感性（无论是历史照片还是用户个人照片）可以被视为一种旨在杜绝类似事件重演的“免疫反应” 16。规模与风险的权衡： 作为一个市值万亿美元、其产品触及全球数十亿用户的公司，谷歌的风险承受能力远低于Midjourney等规模较小的竞争对手。其首要任务是防止大规模的公共危害和相关的品牌形象受损。因此，其安全系统的设计目标是最小化“最坏情况”的发生概率，即使这意味着要牺牲大量正常用例的体验。4.2 对创造力与开发的寒蝉效应尽管谷歌的风险规避策略在商业上有其合理性，但它对依赖其工具的创意和开发者社区造成了显著的负面影响，即所谓的“寒蝉效应”。对创意用户的束缚： 对于艺术家、设计师和内容创作者而言，这些过滤器扼杀了艺术表达的自由。许多探索复杂、边缘或仅仅是稍具争议性主题的合法提示都被拦截，限制了模型的应用范围 16。一个本应激发无限创造力的工具，却因其自身的限制而变得畏首畏尾。对开发者的不确定性： 对于在Gemini API之上构建应用程序的开发者来说，过滤器不一致且不透明的特性构成了一个极不稳定的基础。一个今天运行正常的应用，明天可能因为一次未公开的策略更新或算法调整而瘫痪 17。这种不可预测性使得将Gemini API用于商业产品成为一项高风险的赌注，这与其在发布材料中宣传的作为开发者强大、灵活工具的形象背道而驰 1。4.3 前进之路：对用户、开发者和平台的建议基于本报告的分析，可以为生态系统中的不同参与者提出具体的、可操作的改进路径。对用户和开发者的建议：提示策略优化： 采纳第二节中总结的“规避性提示工程”技巧。使用中性、描述性的语言，避免使用潜在的触发词（如“年轻”、“紧身”）。将请求置于技术性或项目性的框架中，例如，“为我的业余爱好项目……” 20。对于需要多步编辑的复杂任务，每次重大修改后开启一个新的聊天会话，以避免上下文累积导致的性能下降或审查误判 23。善用API控制： 对于拥有Vertex AI访问权限的开发者，应积极试验调整安全阈值。例如，将“危险内容”或“骚扰”等类别的默认拦截级别从BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE下调至BLOCK_ONLY_HIGH，并评估这是否能在不牺牲核心安全的前提下，为特定应用场景提供更大的灵活性 6。对谷歌（平台）的建议：提高透明度： 放弃通用的“违反政策”错误提示，转而提供更具体的反馈。理想情况下，当一个请求被阻止时，API响应应明确指出是哪个危害类别被触发，以及其概率等级。这些信息在API的safetyRatings响应中已经存在，将其开放给开发者将极大地帮助他们调试和优化提示 9。实施分级策略： 为API提供不同的安全策略配置。可以区分一个默认的“消费者安全”等级和一个为开发者/创意专业人士设计的、限制更少但仍有边界的“专业”等级。这将承认不同用户群体具有不同的需求和风险承受能力，从而实现更精细化的管理。优化“人物图像”分类器： 当前处理涉及人物提示的过滤器是一个过于迟钝的工具。谷歌需要投入资源对其进行大幅优化，使其能够区分恶意的篡改和良性的创意编辑。后者构成了图像编辑模型绝大多数的预期用途，对其进行过度限制严重损害了产品的核心价值 1。结论本报告的深入分析揭示了一个核心矛盾：谷歌工程团队创造了世界上最强大的图像编辑模型之一，但其政策和安全团队却用行业中最具限制性、最不透明且最不一致的安全系统之一将其束缚。这个系统的诞生，源于对品牌安全的深切渴望和对过去失败的应激反应，但其现状却严重削弱了该模型对其核心目标用户——创意人士和开发者——的实际效用。Gemini 2.5 Flash Image未来的成功，将不仅仅取决于其技术能力的迭代提升，更关键的是取决于谷歌是否愿意并能够构建一个更加透明、可预测和细致入微的内容审核方法。在人工智能的浪潮中，真正的领导力不仅体现在算法的先进性，更体现在治理的智慧。谷歌需要在保护用户和品牌与赋能创造者之间找到一个更优的平衡点，否则，其最先进的技术可能会因为过度保护而失去应用的舞台。
